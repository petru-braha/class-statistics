# Braha Petru Bogdan: track progress

- Each laboratory has its own unique directory ('lab_*index*'), which contains just one R file with all the demanded solutions. By `lab_1` I mean seventh laboratory.
- Each exercise has one or multiple algorithmic functions and a printing method. Printing can be denoted as `exI1a` (`exI1a` == first set of exercises, first problem, subproblem 'a'). This design can save the memory used by each local variable.Â
