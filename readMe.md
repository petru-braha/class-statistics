# Braha Petru Bogdan: track progress

- Each laboratory has its own unique directory ('lab_*index*'), which contains just one R file with all the demanded solutions. By `lab_1` I mean seventh laboratory.
- Each exercise has one or multiple algorithmic functions and a printing method. Printing can be denoted as `exI1a` (`exI1a` == first set of exercises, first problem, subproblem 'a'). This design can save the memory used by each local variable.

## Default calls, for each exercice, are located at the end of the script! 

## Note: in my free time, i am reviewing my solutions.
please consult the date of my uploads: my labs were sent on time.
